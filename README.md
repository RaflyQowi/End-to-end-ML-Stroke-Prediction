# Stroke Prediction Classification Problem

## Overview
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction of stroke risk can help prevent or reduce the severity of the disease. However, predicting stroke risk is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of various risk factors, such as age, gender, lifestyle, and medical history. Existing stroke prediction models have limitations in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability, and there is a need for more robust and reliable models.

## Data
**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data)

**Dataset Information:** 
- 12 features
- 5110 rows

## Feature Explanation
Here are explanations for the dataset features:

| **Residence_type**| Rural or Urban                                         |
| **avg_glucose_level** | Average glucose level                              |
| **bmi**          | Body Mass Index                                        |
| **smoking_status**| Smoking                                              |
| **stroke**       | 1 (Had a stroke) or 0 (No stroke)                     |

This dataset is intended for building a predictive model to determine stroke risk based on these attributes.
