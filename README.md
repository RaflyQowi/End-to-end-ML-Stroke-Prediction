# Stroke Prediction Classification Problem

## Overview
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction of stroke risk can help prevent or reduce the severity of the disease. However, predicting stroke risk is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of various risk factors, such as age, gender, lifestyle, and medical history. Existing stroke prediction models have limitations in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability, and there is a need for more robust and reliable models.
